# Dotfiles
My final NixOS setup for dotfiles 'cause move to [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) and [LFS](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)
This time with NixOS was really entertaining. Now I will use only NixOS as main system for VPS server.
If you would like to use it so go ahead, you'll like this. If you just want to have the same terminal as I have so go to [arch dotfiles]().
They're written on lua so it compatible with every OS neither NixOS and its nixvim.
Here's screens of my own config:
